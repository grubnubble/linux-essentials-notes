		<h2 class="gold" "first">Intro to Linux</h2>
		<ul class="list">
  			<li>Linux was first on the scene in the early 1990s</li>
  			<li>Considered experimental</li>
  			<li>Now Linux is huge for servers and network services</li>
  			<li>highly configurable</li>
  			<li>also popular for desktop computers</li>
		</ul>  

		<h3 class="gold">Role of an Operating System (<span class="acro">OS</span>)</h3>
		<p class="note">note: an operating system is not an application</p>
		<p>OSs provide 5 key functions in a computer system:</p>
		<ol class="list">
			<li>provides an <u>application platform</u>; the OS manages applications' access to central processing unit (<span class"acro">CPU</span>) and system memory</li>
			<li>serves as a <u>hardware moderator</u> to manage how applications use the computer's hardware
				<p class="eg">eg: OS ensures that one application doesn't try to use memory that is already being used by another application</p>
			</li>
			<li>Uses a filesystem to provide efficient and reliable means for <u>data storage</u></li>
			<li>provides <u>security</u> for its data, to varying degrees depending on the OS</li>
			<li>manages <u>connectivity</u> to other devices</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The Linux Operating System is composed of:
			<ul class="list">
				<li><u>Linux kernel</u>: the actual OS itself, the heart of Linux</li>
				<li><u>Libraries</u>: prewritten code elements that are shared with all applications</li>
				<li><u>Utilities</u>: for completing OS management tasks
					<p class="eg">egs: maintaining filesystem, editing text files, managing running processes, installing new packages</p>
				</li>
				<li><u>User Interface</u>: command line interface (<span class="acro">CLI</span>) and optional graphical user interface (<span class"acro">GUI</span></li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3 class="gold">How Linux Came to Be</h3>
		<p>a grad student in Helsinki, Finland, named <span class="people">Linus Torvalds</span> developed the Linux kernel based on Minix</p>
		<p>Minix was a clone of Unix; it was developed by <span class="people">Dr. Andrew S. Tanenbaum</span> so that he could teach his students about the inner workings ofo an OS; he wanted them to be able to see the source code; it was a minimal freeware OS</p>
		<p>At the time, there were only three main OSs: DOS, Mac OS X, and Unix
			<ul class="list">
				<li>all three were commercially developed, protected by patents and copyrights</li>
				<li>it was not possible to reverse-compile these OSs (<u>reverse-compiling</u> is a process of generating source code, given a binary program file. There are applications that can do this.)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>in 1991, Torvalds cloned Unix and created Linux. It consisted only of the Linux kernel and three utilities: Bourne again shell <span class="acro">bash</span> (commandd line interface), update (for flushing file buffers, whatever that means), and gcc (a C++ compiler)</p>
		<p>Torvalds posted the source code and invited programmers to improve it</p>

		<h3 class="gold">GNU and Linux</h3>
		<p>The GNU's Not Linux (<span class="acro">GNU</span>) movement:
			<ul class="list">
				<li>in the 1980s, Rishard Stallman of MIT objected the to proprietary nature of the corporate software development model</li>
				<li>the idea is that the source code should be freely distributable in order to encourage developers to make improvements to it</li>
				<li>gcc was developed under GNU</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Linux is licensed under GNU General Public License (<span class="acro">GPL</span>) so that anyone can use, modify, or distribute its source code</p>

		<h3 class="gold">Distributions</h3>
		<p>take your basic Linux  OS recipe (ie the source code for the kernel) and add some things (namely tools, utilities, applications) to get different flavors of Linux</p>
		<p>Linux is unique in the OS world for having so many distributions developed by many different people and companies</p>
		<p>there are hundreds of Linux distributions; most are free but some must be paid for</p>

		<h3 class="gold">Life Cycle of a Linux Distribution</h3>
		<p>essentially the same life cycle as any other software:
			<ol class="list">
				<li><u>Design</u>: the goal or purpose of pthe distribution is identified</li>
				<li><u>Develop</u>: the distribution is created according to the plans made in the design phase; usually debugged</li>
				<li><u>Deploy</u>: the completed distribution is released</li>
				<li><u>Manage</u>: bugs are identified; updates are made to fix them every few months</li>
				<li><u>Retire</u>: after support is pulled (ie: after the end of the suppor life cycle), the distribution is obsolete and is retired</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>It's possible (and probable) that newer versions of a particular distribution will come out before the first version is retired. Cool. The different versions will be at different stages of the support life cycle,, though.</p>

		<h2 class="blue" "first">Selecting an Operating System</h2>
		<h3 class="blue">What is an Operating System?</h3>
		<p>provides all the most fundamental features of a computer, software-wise</p>
		<p>enables the use of hardware devices, defines user interface standards, provides basic tools</p>

		<h3 class="blue">What is a Kernel?</h3>
		<p>a software compoment responsible for managing low-level features:
			<ul class="list">
				<li>interfacing with hardware devices</li>
				<li>allocating memory to programs</li>
				<li>allocating CPU time to programs</li>
				<li>enabling programs to interact with each other</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>the kernel is the basis; other programs run on top of it</p>
		<p>the kernel is the software "glue" that holds the computer together</p>
		<p>kernels are not interchangeable: they have different internal designs, provide different software interfaces</p>
		<p>the Linux kernel is called Linux (technically Linux <em>only</em> refers to the kernel</p>
		<h3 class="blue">What Else Identifies an Operating System?</h3>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Command line shells: <span class="eg">eg Bourne again shell (<span class="acro">bash</span>)</span></li>
			<li>GUI</li>
			<li>Utility programs: <span class="eg">egs: calendars, calculators, text editors, disk maintenance tools, etc.</span></li>
			<li>Libraries: provide critical services to programs; collections of programming functions that can be used by many different programs; <span class="eg">eg: libc</span></li>
			<li>Productivity programs: web browsers, word processors, etc</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Operating systems can be distinguished also by details of user accounts, rules for naming disc files, details of the computer's start up</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>these details are sometimes controlled by the kernel, sometimes not</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="blue">Investigating User Interfaces</h2>
		<p>Most operating systems have GUIs, but Linux is still largely text-oriented</p>
		<h3 class="blue">Using a Text-Mode Interface</h3>
		<p>Linux computers used to load to a text login screen, which included the OS name and version, the computer's name, the name of the hardware device being used for login, and the login prompt</p>
		<p>$ - regular prompt</p>
		<p># - root prompt</p>
		<p>it's always possible to use a text-mode shell in a GUI: this window is called a terminal</p>
		<h3 classs="blue">Using a Graphical User Interface</h3>
		<span class="eg">GUI egs: GNOME, KDE, Xfce, Unity</span>
		<p>GUI features:
			<ul class="list">
				<li><u>Program Launchers</u>: by selecting from menus, lists, or icons</li>
				<li><u>File Managers</u>: to navigate directories</li>
				<li><u>Window Controls</u>: windows are clickable, draggable, resizeable</li>
				<li><u>Multiple Desktops</u>: can switch among virtual desktops</li>
				<li><u>Logout Options</u>: log out, shut down, or log in as another user</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>GUIs can be changed or swapped out</p>

		<h2 class="blue">Where does Linux fit in the OS World?</h2>
		<p>as compared to Unix, Mac OS X, and MS Windows?</p>
		<p><span class="note">note: Linux can be considered a family of operating systems</span></p>
		<h3 class="blue">Comparing Linux to Unix</h3>
		<p>Linux is modeled after Unix</p>
		<p>Unix was created in 1969 at AT&ampT's Bell Labs</p>
		<p>some open source projects that were cloned from or made for Unix include:
			<ul class="list">
				<li></li>
			</ul>
